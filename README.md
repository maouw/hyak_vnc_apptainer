Sample VNC Apptainer
====================

This repo contains sample Apptainer recipes along with a Makefile to build one
on UW Hyak Klone.

These Apptainer containers are used by `hyakvnc.py` to start a VNC session.

Available Apptainers:

- ~~`ubuntu20.04_min`~~
- ~~`ubuntu20.04`~~
- ~~`rockylinux8_min`~~
- ~~``rockylinux8`~~
- `ubuntu22.04_interactive`
- `ubuntu22.04_xubuntu`


Minimized/barebones container recipes, suffixed with `_min`, are provided with
XFCE4, vncserver, and dependencies to run Lmod and build/run Apptainers.

Standard recipes, without any suffix, provide additional tools and libraries
required for **some** programs.

These container recipes are provided to serve as examples and are meant to be
modified to user needs.

## Build Steps

Following guidance from [Hyak's Documentation](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/tools/containers),
We will need to build the container on an interactive work node:

```bash
salloc -A <mygroup> -p <mypartition> -N 1 -n2 --mem=10G --time=2:00:00
# connect to allocated node. Example: ssh n3300
ssh <node_name>
module load apptainer/1.1.5
```

Navigate to this directory then run `make` with the name of container specified:

```bash
cd /path/to/hyak_vnc_apptainer
make CONT_NAME=rockylinux
```

If successful, a container file ending with .sif can be found in the directory
with the same name as the container.
